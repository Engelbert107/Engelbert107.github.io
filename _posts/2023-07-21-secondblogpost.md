The terms outliers, anomalies and influential points are used in statistics to describe different types of atypical data points that can have an impact on data analysis. Here are the differences between these terms.

Outliers (Valeurs ExtrÃªmes) :
Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the data distribution. These points are often located at the extreme end of the distribution and can be far away from the other observations. Outliers may result from measurement errors, incorrect data entry, or represent exceptional cases. They can affect statistical calculations such as the mean and standard deviation and may influence the results of an analysis.

Anomalies (Valeurs Aberrantes) :
Anomalies are data points that appear inconsistent with the rest of the data in a specific context. Unlike outliers, anomalies are not necessarily located at the extreme end of the distribution, but they can simply be values that seem unusual or unexpected compared to the overall model or trend of the data. Anomalies may result from unusual processes or exceptional circumstances and may require special attention in the analysis.

Influential Points (Valeurs Influentes) :
Influential points are data points that have a significant influence on the results of a statistical analysis, such as linear regression. These points often have a disproportionate effect on the estimates of the statistical model parameters. Influential points can be outliers or anomalies, but not always. They are often identified using statistical measures such as studentized residuals or Cook's distance.

By starting with the concept of remote sensing, I describe remote sensing as a physical constituents of nature with data collected via sensors (like satellites, aircraft). These sensors can monitor and collect data on different aspects of Earth. Some of them include vegetation data, atmosphere data, ocean data, etc. They provide the data in form of heat maps or images. Image processing and masking are fundamental tools required to extract information from the data collected by the sensors.

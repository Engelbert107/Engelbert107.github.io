Hi! I'm Engelbert, Data scientist with a background in Computer Science,  Applied Mathematics, Machine Intelligence, Deep Learning (Computer Vision, NLP).

Currently, I'm part of the Ishango.ai Data Science fellowship program based in Rwanda. I have a master in Mathematical Sciences with majoring in Big data and computer security.  For my project with the host company, I'm working with satellite imagery by using remote sensing which is a technique used to collect data about the earth without taking a physical sample of earth's surface.

I aspire work in an industry that is interested in building model and data analysis where he can apply his data science, machine learning, computer vision and satellite imagery analysis skill.

I like to learn new things. 

My hobbies: I like to run, read, watching movies, listening music.

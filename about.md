Hi! I'm Engelbert Tchinde, Data scientist with a background in Computer Science,  Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning (Computer Vision, NLP).

My expertise in these fields lies in data analysis, data visualisation, statistical learning, data engineering and data modelling. However, I am interested in a range of topics involving technical know-how.

Currently, I'm part of the Ishango.ai Data Science fellowship program based in Rwanda. I have a master in Mathematical Sciences with majoring in Big data and computer security.  For my project with the host company, I'm working with satellite imagery by using remote sensing which is a technique used to collect data about the earth without taking a physical sample of earth's surface.

I aspire work in an industry that is interested in building model and data analysis where he can apply his data science, machine learning, computer vision and satellite imagery analysis skill.

I like to learn new things. 

My hobbies: I like to run, read, watching movies, listening music.

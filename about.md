Hi! I'm Engelbert, Data scientist with a background in Mathematics, Machine Intelligence, Deep Learning (Computer Vision, NLP).
I like to learn new things. I am very organized. 

I aspire work in an industry that is interested in modelling and solving problems of any kind, and also build a model and the analysis of data where I could apply my data science skill.

My hobbies: I like to run, read, watching movies, listening music.
